📌 Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of health insurance coverage across the United States. Using Tableau, I analyzed historical data to identify trends in coverage types (Public vs. Private), shifts in the uninsured population, and geographical disparities in healthcare access. The dashboard serves as a strategic tool for understanding how policy changes and economic shifts affect insurance status at the state and national levels.

📊 Key Insights
Coverage Shifts: Tracked the transition between private and public insurance over time, highlighting years with significant growth in government-sponsored coverage.

Geographical Disparities: Identified "coverage deserts" and states with the highest rates of uninsured citizens, providing a clear view of regional healthcare access gaps.

Public vs. Private Analysis: Segmented the population to show the balance between employer-based insurance and public options like Medicare and Medicaid.

Uninsured Trends: Visualized the reduction or increase in the uninsured rate over time, allowing for a direct assessment of historical healthcare policy impacts.

🛠️ Technical Toolkit
Advanced Visualizations: Utilized filled maps for geographical analysis, line charts for time-series trends, and stacked bar charts for coverage distribution.

Data Aggregation: Used Calculated Fields to determine percentage changes in coverage and to normalize data across states with varying populations.

Interactivity: Integrated state-level filters and year sliders to allow users to perform their own year-over-year comparisons.

UI/UX Design: Applied a professional, healthcare-themed color palette and optimized the layout for clarity and fast decision-making.
